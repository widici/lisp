# Rango

> [!WARNING]
> This project is in early development expect some issues and code-breaking changes

Rango is a small toy programming language targeting BEAM bytecode with a Lisp-inspired syntax, written in Gleam.

## Examples

```lisp
(fn greet [Str name] (
    (putsln (<> "Hello " name "! :D"))
))
```

More examples can be found in the [examples directory](./examples).

## Installation

## Usage

For a quick overview of the cli the help command can be used:

```sh
rango --help
```

### Build

The build command compiles the source-code read from the provided path and outputs a beam file in the current working directory. The subcommand is used like this:

```sh
rango build <file_path>
```

Although the [run command](#run) is generally recommended the beam file can also be executed using Erlang's built in REPL, which doesn't require recompiling to run an already compiled program. It can be used like this:

```sh
$ erl
> code:add_path(".").
> code:load_file(<file_name>).
> <file_name>:<function_name>(<params>).
```

Full example with [fibonacci example program](./examples/fib.lisp):

```sh
$ rango build ./examples/fib.lisp
$ erl
> code:add_path(".").
> code:load_file(fib).
> fib:fib(0, 1, 10).
```

### Run

The program can also be ran directly using the run subcommand which firstly compiles the program (even if it's unchanged) and then runs it, like this:

```sh
rango run <file_path> <function_name> <..params>
```

The params are in this case Erlang terms split with spaces without an ending dot.

Here is the same example with the [fibonacci example program](./examples/fib.lisp) but with the run command instead:

```sh
rango run ./examples/fib.lisp fib 0 1 10
```

### Load

There is also the load subcommand that compiles and validates the BEAM file with the [code/load_file:1](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/kernel/code.html#load_file/1) Erlang function. This is also done with the [run subcommand](#run) but the load command doesnÂ´t also run the program, the load command can be used like this:

```sh
rango load <file_path>
```

This subcommand is mainly meant to be used for quick debugging while developing the langauge itself.

- [x] Lex operators (e.g. arithmetic operators, comparison operators, etc.)
- [x] Lex parentheses & square brackets
- [x] Lex special keywords
- [x] Lex regular identifiers
- [x] Improve lexing of literals with the usage of regex
- [x] Lex spans in source-code for tokens
- [x] Lex column and row position for span instead of linear position
- [x] Lex comments

### Parser
